Torque Script is the powerful C++ like scripting language built into the core of the Torque Shader Engine.  Torque Script reduces your development time by allowing you to quickly associate scripted logic and data to engine objects at runtime without exiting the engine. Take a look at any of the numerous .cs and .gui files that come with this demo and you will see just how extensively Torque Script can be leveraged to get your project done quickly.
