## OpenMBU Fan Revival License
*For the love of the game. Not for profit.*

OpenMBU is a fan-made recreation of *Marble Blast Ultra*, originally developed by GarageGames. This project exists to preserve, celebrate, and expand on the legacy of a game we love. We don't own the original IP, and we're not trying to profit.

OpenMBU comes in two editions. The main project, [OpenMBU](https://github.com/MBU-Team/OpenMBU), is focused on preservation. It allows non‑commercial remixing. [OpenMBU+](https://github.com/MBU-Team/OpenMBU-Plus) is a forked edition that adds new features and content. It is released under stricter [licensing](https://github.com/MBU-Team/OpenMBU-Plus?tab=License-1-ov-file) that prohibits remixing, reuse, and redistribution.
