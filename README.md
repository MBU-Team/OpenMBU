OpenMBU is a revival of Marble Blast Ultra, originally developed by GarageGames and released on January 25, 2006 on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360.

Marble Blast Ultra quickly became one of XBLA's standout titles, selling over 24,000 copies in its first few days. It rose into the [top Xbox Live games list](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2006/02/11/marble-blast-rolls-into-the-top-xbox-live-games-list/) next to classics like Halo 2, Call of Duty 2, & Dead or Alive 4, games that defined an era. <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1456052145504780318.webp?size=128&animated=true" width="19" height="19">

The game stayed popular throughout the Xbox 360's lifespan, ultimately selling more than 756,000 copies. Between 2006 and 2010 it regularly ranked in the Top 10 and later Top 20 most-played XBLA titles, before it was removed from the Xbox Live Marketplace in early 2011.

OpenMBU revives the original with new features like controller options, fan-made content, Discord support, and more.
